Digital Privacy Code of Practice {draft v0.01- May 25, 2023}  

Implementing a transparency code of conduct as defined in law with this Digital Privacy Code of Practice, which uses international privacy law, completely interoperable with the GDPR, with ISO standards, to implement transparency code of conduct.

Intro
[. ] 
1. All processing must be transparent, even secret surveillance required a notice at a societal level, records and democratic oversight, as weak as explicit legislated exemptions, and specify obligations that must be monitored,  
3. all  digital identity management and related services (meta-data) processing must be transparent, specified according to purpose and provide to whose benefit
4. If an organization processes PII it must provide a notice, or post a public notice of processing, and to what benefit
5. 

 Principles 
1. This expected conduct applies to all stakeholder’s and is extensible to exhaustively include all contexts (MC art 29)
2. All notice and communication must be concentric.,
3. Individual Control, Consent & Choice to share, as democratically defined in the rule of law (the reason we have it) (MC art 40) 
4. The individual Always has the right and capability to access digital privacy rights information independently that provide assurance.   (Digital privacy rights code of practice in progress)[MC art 40]
5. Access to rights, controls and justice, in proportion and with reciprocal technological effect - As dynamic.
6. For higher assurance when the legal justification for processing personal data is explicit, the individual MUST have the option to specify their own private data sources and profiles. [Freedom and Control]

Digital Privacy Code of Conduct
This code of conduct is universal set of rules for security transparency and respect for privacy that apply to all stakeholders ( digital services ) as they capture and process personal data across (Trans) boarder.  

The code is individual centric, it’s purpose is to provide the individual with transparency over control and access to the choice as to wether or not personal information is digitally surveilled. (aka  metadata (digital identigire generated PII)

This Code of Conduct specifies how to apply laws with standards for the individual’s security.  How to do so in a consistent technicak manner, using a standard record format, ontology, and protoco for regulated, decentralized, data governance and trust. 

The Code of Conduct, that is applied as legal privacy instrument, for the purpose of a public digital privacy framework, can be  applied to any privacy stakeholder, by any privayc stakeholder in any data capture, processing or use context, with this corresponding code of practice. 

The  transparency practices are the corresponding technical processes protocol for Authorization from Consent. Used to standardize notice approach for a much higher quality of consent, engagement participation and trust.  Normalizing the digital notice and electronic consent protocol for permissions and preferences across contexts and types of data, for the human to be the point of choice and control  interoperable with existing security and privacy governance frameworks. 

Governance (standard), Authority(person), Consent (to purpose), Permission (a method for permission), and standard approach to Preferences 

- Digital Data Governance 
    - Public Rules are specified by privacy regulation / legislation, which can a) be mapped to this code of conduct, b) be used to enhance local, regional and national privacy and security requirements 
    - Rules between a person and a system is concentric governance digital privacy
    - Rules between services - are contract - which implement the code of conduct in it’s terms and conditions,.  All services require a notice credential.
- Authority
- DP Consent is specified according to the purpose of the service and context 
    - The purpose bundles the permissions according to the scope of the purpose (and is explicit consent)
        - Permissions set the access controls utilizing digital id security technologies designed for greater personal data control - (See SSI)
        - Permissions should be accessible in the initial Digital Privacy Notice
        - In time, and in context notifications, and pop-ups are used to managed preferences of this privacy framework and is not considered Consent.  
            - Tick boxes to Terms or conditions, (a contract) is not consent) are not consent . 
            - Tick boxes to linked Privacy policies (that 3% click on) are for permissions, or preference, which is implied consent to the purpose of the service,  and the notified active state of digital privacy.  
    - 
- Delegation of Authority, in democracies, is through the consensus of the people in any state. As such; 
    - The Individual can delegate, or has delegated for them by legislation according to standardized legal justifications  
    - The Controller/Owner can delegate authority to a DPO, who can further delegate authority of the controller, to employees and processors.   
    - The Regulator delegates authority to the Controller
